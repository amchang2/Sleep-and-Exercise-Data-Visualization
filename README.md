# Sleep and Exercise Data Visualization

This Data Visualization and Analysis project explores if there is a relationship between sleep and physical activity among adults who are overweight. To analyze this relationship, we quantified quality of sleep by measuring the average minutes slept each night. We quantified physical activity by measuring an individual's average step count per day.

This project was completed entirely in Python on Jupyter Notebooks for a UCSD course, Data Science in Practice (Cogs 108).

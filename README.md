Sleep and Exercise Data Visualization

This Data Visualization and Analysis project explores if there is a relationship between sleep and physical activity among adults that are overweight. To analyze this relationship, we quantified quality of sleep by measuring the average minutes slept each night. We quantified physical activity by measuring an individuals average step count per day.

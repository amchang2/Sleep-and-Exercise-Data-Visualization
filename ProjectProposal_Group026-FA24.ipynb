    "Is there a relationship between quality of sleep and exercise, specifically running? To analyze this relationship, we will be quantifying quality of sleep by measuring the number of sleep cycles an individual goes through each night. We will be quanitfiying running performance by measuring an individuals heartbeat by analyzing their beats per minute. We will be sure to account for variables such as experience level, age and gender."

    "There are many factors that influence sleep, whether that be age, alcohol, or stress. It is shared knowledge that exercise plays a role in the quality and quantity of sleep. It is normal for one to feel more sleepy or drained after exercising. When exercising you're increasing both blood flow and heart rate making you more awake and wired. After some time, sleepiness occurs. The reason for that is because as we exercise our energy in the form of ATP is depleted as our muscles contract and there's an increase in neurotransmitters, resulting in muscle fatigue. [1] We hope to further prove this point by tracking the heart rate of runners and the quality of sleep one gets through their sleep cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many studies done to support the idea of running having positive effects on people's sleep. One study conducted a test with 51 healthy adolescents running regularly in the morning and compared them to control subjects. They examined the electoencepahlographic patterns and psychological functionings of both groups before and after the three week period. By the end of the test the results were that \"objective sleep improved (slow-wave sleep increased; sleep onset latency decreased) in the running group compared with the control group\". [2] Supporting the hypothesis that the quality of sleep improves when running. However, this is only accounting for those in the age of adolescence, the mean age of 18.30 years, so it fails to account for any people older than the age of adolescence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study was done to investigate the effects of exercise in those of an older age group. This study was conducted on participants 40 years or older with the mean age being 62 years old. Participants were then a part of a 12-week exercise training program. Data was measured through sleep quality assessments, a cardiopulmonary exercise test, and heart rate variability assessment. At the end of the program the results were that moderate intensity exercise training had a beneficial significance between exercise and cardiac autonomic function. [3] The study suggests, even those older who exercise also experience better sleep, similar to the benefits observed in the adolescents.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many studies we have found support the claim that exercise enhances the sleep quality, we aim to be more specific in our findings. Showcasing the correlation of heart rate when running to the sleep cycles, and the improvement in sleep quality. Additionally considering how the level of experience and gender can connect and affect the outcome as well.\n",

    "With this research topic investigating the correlation between intensity of exercise and quality of sleep, it is critical to consider the ethical constraints regarding this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research question, in particular, reveals weaknesses including overgeneralizing the research findings. If there is indeed a positive correlation between intensity of exercise and quality of sleep, it could possibly overlook other factors, such as stress or mental health, that could also play a part in these findings. In addition to this, we must consider how equitable and accessible exercise is for certain portions of the population. Not all participants will have equal access to exercise whether it be walking or running which could cause a disparity for if exercise affects sleep. If participants do not have access to exercise, yet have varying levels of sleep quality, this has the potential to skew the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the data proposed, there exists a possibility for bias in terms of the demographic of the sample population, self-reported data, and participants with more experienced exercise levels which would skew the data. The data could possibly reflect that of a certain age group, region, etc. Participants could also report their own quantifiable statistics such as heart rate and number of sleep cycles, disrupting the validity and control of the data collected. The third crucial bias was the varying exercise experience levels; one participant's high intensity rate could look entirely different from another participant's high intensity rate. Additionally, when considering sensitive personal data like heart rate and sleep cycles, it is also of importance for our group to consider the ethical implications of consent and data sharing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to mitigate these ethical concerns, our groups plans to address them from a top-down perspective. When starting our research for more datasets, we plan to parse through for diverse datasets that cover a large variety of demographics and health status. This will aid us, going forward with an intentional goal of minimizing selection bias and considering the more nuanced intersections of participants. Additionally, to maximize accuracy of results and to reduce self-reported data, our datasets should reflect those that have utilized standardized measuring systems such as heart rate monitors or sleep detectors. Lastly, the participants' safety and privacy is of upmost priority. Thus, finding datasets where participants have given consent and also retaining their anonymity will remain at the forefront of our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once datasets have been collected, our group will continue to remain attentive of potential bias by analyzing the patterns and ensuring that the data is taking account of different demographic groups. This will continue to persist for the entire duration of the analysis phase. The post-analysis phase will consist of being transparent with the findings and discussing how biases may have influenced the results in any way. Throughout the entire process, our group intends to check in regularly with the data to detect biases and pivot our direction, if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective for detecting bias is staying transparent with not only each other, but with the public. It is important that we are transparent with the limitations our research faces as well as the ways in which our group mitigates them. "

    "\n",
    "The research question, in particular, reveals weaknesses including overgeneralizing the research findings. If there is indeed a positive correlation between intensity of exercise and quality of sleep, it could possibly overlook other factors, such as stress or mental health, that could also play a part in these findings. In addition to this, we must consider how equitable and accessible exercise is for certain portions of the population. Not all participants will have equal access to exercise whether it be walking or running which could cause a disparity for if exercise affects sleep. If participants do not have access to exercise, yet have varying levels of sleep quality, this has the potential to skew the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the data proposed, there exists a possibility for bias in terms of the demographic of the sample population, self-reported data, and participants with more experienced exercise levels which would skew the data. The data could possibly reflect that of a certain age group, region, etc. Participants could also report their own quantifiable statistics such as heart rate and number of sleep cycles, disrupting the validity and control of the data collected. The third crucial bias was the varying exercise experience levels; one participant's high intensity rate could look entirely different from another participant's high intensity rate. Additionally, when considering sensitive personal data like heart rate and sleep cycles, it is also of importance for our group to consider the ethical implications of consent and data sharing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to mitigate these ethical concerns, our groups plans to address them from a top-down perspective. When starting our research for more datasets, we plan to parse through for diverse datasets that cover a large variety of demographics and health status. This will aid us, going forward with an intentional goal of minimizing selection bias and considering the more nuanced intersections of participants. Additionally, to maximize accuracy of results and to reduce self-reported data, our datasets should reflect those that have utilized standardized measuring systems such as heart rate monitors or sleep detectors. Lastly, the participants' safety and privacy is of upmost priority. Thus, finding datasets where participants have given consent and also retaining their anonymity will remain at the forefront of our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once datasets have been collected, our group will continue to remain attentive of potential bias by analyzing the patterns and ensuring that the data is taking account of different demographic groups. This will continue to persist for the entire duration of the analysis phase. The post-analysis phase will consist of being transparent with the findings and discussing how biases may have influenced the results in any way. Throughout the entire process, our group intends to check in regularly with the data to detect biases and pivot our direction, if needed.\n",
